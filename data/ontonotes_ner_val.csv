China is Capable of withstanding the Impacts Brought to China by US Economic Recession .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Following the recession in 2001 , the US economy has entered into "" soft - landing "" adjustment after five years of continuous expansion .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Some expect that in 2007 the US economic growth rate will drop to 1.9 - 2.5 percent , the interest rate will drop to 4 percent , and the US dollar will continue to depreciate .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Once the US economy is in recession , will impacts will it bring to China ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Pressure brought to China by the US economic recession .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The United States is the powerhouse of the world economy and the largest international market .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The USD$ 800 - billion annual trade deficit indicates global exports are heavily dependent on the US .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The US is our No. 2 trade partner , No. 1 export market , No. 6 import source , and No. 3 technology import source .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"China 's total export value was USD $ 875 billion from January to November 2006 , of which 21 % was export to the US .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Plus the portion re-exported from Hong Kong , export to the US accounted for over 35 percent of the total Chinese export value .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Export of Chinese shipping , low - end electronics , furniture , textiles and artware could all be affected should the US experience economic recession .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In addition , other developing countries in Asia are major suppliers in the supply chain centered around China , and the supply chain is driven by the US demand .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"As a result , slowdown of the US economy represents a huge pressure for the entire Asia .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Some expect that China 's export growth rate will decrease from 23 percent to 15 percent in 2007 .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If the government sit by and watch , the Chinese economic growth rate will drop 3 - 4 percent .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
China is fully capable of withstanding the impacts .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Regardless of the accuracy of various comments , China must be prepared to cope with the US economic recession .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Although some predictions are a little sensational , the author believes the US economic recession this time will not be very severe , with less impacts on China than other countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"By taking some proactive measures , the Chinese economy is fully capable of withstanding such impacts .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"From the current situation , strong domestic investment within China has fully compensated the impact of the decrease in net export .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Raw materials imported take a large percentage in the costs of the Chinese exports .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The appreciation of RMB could , in the first place , lower costs .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It can be expected that neither the appreciation of RMB nor the global economic recession will seriously impact Chinese export .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It would be exaggerating to say China is 70 percent dependent on foreign trade .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The statistics has underestimated China 's Gross National Product -LRB- GNP -RRB- , especially that of the tertiary sector .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"As more than half of the Chinese foreign trade is processing trade , it would be overestimating the total foreign trade to count import and export repeatedly .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The author estimates that our country actually might be 40 percent dependent on foreign trade .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Therefore , there is no need to magnify China 's dependence on export to the US .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Export - oriented economic growth of China should be cooled down , while the role of domestic demand and import should be promoted .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If factors such as the rapid development of the tertiary sector and the appreciation of RMB are taken into consideration , China 's dependence on foreign trade can be controlled at around 50 percent in the long run .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Long - term export of Chinese products at low prices will lead to "" impoverished wealth growth , "" and we should specially understand the "" wealth "" as domestic environmental resources .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The environmental costs in our country account for approximately 30 percent of product costs , but are not incorporated into product prices .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And this is the primary reason why Chinese products are cheap .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is imperative to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers , internalize external environmental costs of Chinese products as soon as possible , and increase the prices of most products , including exports , in order to alleviate international trade frictions , reduce the pressure for RMB appreciation , and in particular change the prospect that the Chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In addition , the Chinese population is huge and young , which enables the Chinese economy to enjoy the "" population dividends . """,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"However , to depress the consumption rate to lower than 40 percent will certainly lead to overproduction , and cheap goods will in turn impact the international market .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If the US economic recession would indeed affect our export , it would not necessarily be a bad thing in the author 's view .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Over the last 20 years , the world has experienced many economic crashes , affecting countries or regions such as Russia , Arab , Latin America and East Asia .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The US also suffered stock market crash in 2001 .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
China is the only one to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Whenever there is an international economic recession , China would actively expand domestic demand to create market for different countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact , China has long been a responsible big nation , playing a stabilizing role to the international society .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Long - term high - speed growth in China has led to significant wealth growth , as well as different kinds of disequilibriums , such as : too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions ; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing , and insufficient investment in national defense , science and technology , education , health , environment and national reserves ; wider income gap , regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; the economy has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long - term export orientation and trade surplus to the United States ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting , so on and so forth .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"By now , high - speed growth of the Chinese economy has entered the final acceleration period that will span over a decade .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Beginning 2007 , the economic aggregate is expected to increase sharply by 150 percent , leading to the "" historical disequilibrium development "" predicted by Soros .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is also why China is not afraid of a global economic crisis and capable of digesting it .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"However , after 2020 , China will be facing the puzzle of population aging , which is sure to witness an economic slowdown .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As an expectation , there will be leading overreactions in financial and real estate areas by around 2015 .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Within these years , the sharply grown wealth of RMB? 40 trillion shall be used effectively in areas including national defense , science and technology , environment , national soil renovation , and adjusting social relations .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of China must be adjusted .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"From this perspective , the US economic recession imposes external pressure on the economic restructuring , which is also an opportunity .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Whether the impacts brought to China by the US economic recession can be resisted and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated hinge on whether or not China can truly expand its domestic demand .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The next few years may see the Chinese economy cooling down , a continuous modest rise in RMB , a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth , a possible decrease in trade surplus , and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control , which are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between China and the United States and between China and the world , as well as in the social relations within China .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"[jilian] However , the views of the Chinese embassy in Russia on this matter , obtained through Internet channels , gives one pause :",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] "" With regard to Russia 's newly revised immigration law , "" says Ambassador Liu , "" in the short term , implementation of Russia 's new law will have a certain effect on Chinese businessmen traveling in China , but in the long term , it will benefit the long - range business and development of Chinese businesses there .

"[jilian] Responding to the host 's questions about this , Professor Wang Lijiu , Russian affairs expert with the China Contemporary International Affairs Institute , in a relaxed tone , again stressed : Russia is not targeting the Chinese in particular ; Russia is entitled to regulate its markets ; Chinese people should adapt as quickly as possible .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"[jilian] In his view , it seems this matter does not affect him at all , and there is no sign that he has any empathy for his Chinese compatriots .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] The attitude revealed by China 's ambassador and the Russian expert leaves people bewildered ; is the ambassador so weak that he does not dare raise any objection ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Given China 's current international position , this seems impossible !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Is he stooping to compromise on the matter for the sake of the overall situation of the two countries ' relations , therefore being unable to negotiate with Russia ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] We must not underestimate the intelligence and efforts of the embassy comrades ; in terms of Professor Wang Lijiu 's explanation , since Russia established this policy , the embassy has already negotiated .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[jilian] But if they have negotiated , then why is Russia still carrying out this barbaric , large - scale expulsion of Chinese ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] In terms of how Russia and the Russians have been understood for years , it 's another case of the Russkies not buying what the Chinese embassy is selling ; that is , it 's their little plot of land and whatever they say goes ; not even God can interfere -LRB- that 's the character of the Russian race -RRB- .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Looking at it in this way , we can understand the plight faced by the embassy ; when you negotiate with Russia , the Russkies do n't listen , and moreover there are some practical questions in this situation .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Getting hostile with the Russkies is also too unreasonable ; in today 's international environment , relations between the two countries are so important that if we fall out over this , it 's really losing sight of the forest for the trees ; the result of conflict is so grave that nobody can take the responsibility for it .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] But with the vital interests of tens of thousands of compatriots in Russia and pressure at home , the embassy can not help but offer explanations .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Therefore , making that kind of strange remark through Internet channels - using the rationale of Russia putting its markets in order and cleaning out foreign immigrants to gloss over Russia 's irrational harshness and appease the anger of our countrymen .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] For a long time since the Chinese and their products have been entering Russia , they 've set off on an arduous journey .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] They 've experienced Russia 's heavy customs duties and extortion , and in the markets they 've endured all sorts of piratical taxes and intimidation including the police - infested underworld , and the increasingly harsh , blatant robbery committed by Russian government agencies against the Chinese in the name of "" gray customs procedures "" ; all these things show that the action taken by the Russians this time just had to happen .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] If it did n't happen today , it would tomorrow .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And since this happened today , it means that in a not - too - distant future , even tomorrow , Russia will take even more extreme measures to cope with those Chinese !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] With regard to Russia 's repeated extortion and elbowing out of the Chinese -LRB- in fact we ca n't find any other more accurate or appropriate terms for it -RRB- , the Chinese government , in its recorded negotiations with the Russians , has never told us anything workable for this situation .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Therefore it is said that in the policy adopted by Russia today there are certainly elements of the Chinese side having negotiated weakly , leaving the Russians room to cause problems .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"With the IQ of the Chinese , is it really impossible to solve this problem ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Beginning with the breakup of the Soviet Union , Chinese light - industrial products gradually took over a large share of Russia 's markets , and in the Russian view this has definitely not been a good thing .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] But it was precisely these Chinese products that rescued and sustained the Russian markets .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] If there had been no good - quality , low - priced goods coming from China , the Russian people would in fact have been unable to endure the low - income life after the breakup of the Soviet Union .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] From clothing to toys to slippers and household items , it was Chinese goods that kept Russian prices stable at a level that ordinary Russians could bear .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Without the support of Chinese goods , the price of every commodity in Russia would have risen sharply !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] Professor Wang Lijiu 's view is not correct .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He says that , if there had been no low - priced goods from the Chinese market , it would only have affected the lower levels of society and those collecting pensions .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] "" In Russia , ordinary working people are the vast majority , the bulk of consumers , and every weekend , or on a certain day in each household , the head of the household regularly makes a special trip to the Chinese market to buy goods , and this has become a part of their everyday lives .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Without Chinese goods , they could only go buy so - called medium - and high - end goods , and with these goods being in short supply , the prices of all medium - and high - end goods would rise , without exception .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] Therefore we say that the actions taken by the Russians now will have negative effects on all of Russia .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] From Web sites we can see that Russia already thought of these kinds of effects when it formulated this policy of expelling the Chinese .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] In 2003 , SARS broke out in Beijing , China and Russia closed their seaport customs offices , and prices soared in just a short time in Russia 's Far Eastern regions , and the local people 's reaction was unusually harsh and negative .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] From this we can see and confirm this news : Chinese goods affect the lives of a large share of the Russian people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] When the lives of the Russian people are impacted by rising prices , they will certainly be displeased with their government .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] When the Russian people are dissatisfied with their government , there will certainly be people demanding that the government take , or the government will on its own take , measures to resolve the people 's discontent !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Our on - line folks should rest assured on this point ; Russia is a democratic autarchy , and sometimes the efficiency with which it takes actions that correspond to the people 's demands is quite high .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Moreover , our experts point out that the actions taken by the Russian government and Putin 's election strategy are related .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[jilian] Even if it 's to win over people 's minds , the Russian government could certainly pass a law to resolve the price issue .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

[jilian] Do n't we really understand we Chinese in fact hold the power to resolve this issue in our hands !,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] There are three strategies for resolving this issue : Best , middle and worst .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[jilian] Worst strategy : speak out strongly against the Russian government 's expulsion of the Chinese and appeal for the safeguarding of Chinese dignity ; suspend all trade with Russia .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] But when we do this , it will undoubtedly damage the fine relationship that China and Russia worked together to establish .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"[jilian] Although our compatriots will suffer losses , at least the sky is not falling ; the Chinese are the world 's most adaptable race , and by gritting our teeth we can always get through this .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] But when we do this , how can we face the tens of thousands of our compatriots in Russia , how can we face the fervent expectations of the people in China toward their government ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] And as for the Russian government , it can only step up its deprecation and belittling of the concerned parties in China , and further foster its deliberate aggression and arrogance .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] It gets more overbearing every day , stirring up a new tempest between the two countries and leaving behind hidden dangers !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Do not cross swords directly with the Russian government ; in the name of strengthening Sino - Russian friendship , improving the inherent quality of products and strengthening product quality control , apply strict quality control to goods headed for Russia .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Beginning now , if one Chinese product does not meet product quality requirements , regardless of whether it is clothing or shoes and hats , all of the products in the hands of commodity inspection agents are inferior products .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] For the sake of Sino - Russian friendship , we must bear responsibility for the Russian people , and we can not send substandard goods outside the country !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] With this approach , China 's foreign affairs offices can conscientiously explain to the outside world that we are doing this for the sake of developing regular trade and friendship between the two countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] Comrade ambassador , you have recently been harshly castigated by the Chinese people ; take this opportunity to go to the Alps for some R & R and do a little skiing ; go to Hawaii to go surfing and relax , and let the Russian officials look all over the world without finding you .",0,1,1,0,0,0,0

[jilian] This approach provides timely help to our compatriots in Russia and it is the best support !,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[jilian] With Chinese products not coming in , warehouses are ultimately limited , and scarce goods become expensive ; there will be no urgency to sell off goods that are n't coming in regularly , and people will come up with ways to use their legal status to protect their goods and themselves , and sell off the goods they do have at a good price -LRB- in Russia , things wo n't sell slowly anyhow -RRB- .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"[buabua] With regard to China 's development , for most workers and farmers , the fruit of economic development is like a black hole .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Why has n't there been substantial change in the living conditions of most common people after nearly 30 years of reform ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Zhong Dajun , Beijing Dajun Economic Observation & Research Center",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] To sum up , China 's current economy has many features , but today I would like to talk mainly about these four points .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] I. the large investment scale of 32 trillion,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] The first feature is certainly the high economic growth and large investment scale .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Over these years , our country has been a country with unusually high economic growth in the world , and its achievements in construction often surprise the people from developed countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] For example , the construction of the Water Cube Swimming Center of the Beijing Olympic Stadium in today 's news report can be called the world first class .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] According to the new data announced by statistics department a few days ago , the investment projects under construction have totaled 32 trillion yuan in our country at present , 7 trillion more than last year 's 25 trillion .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Thirty - two trillion yuan , converted into US dollars , is around 4 trillion US dollars .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] When the Japanese journalists had an interview with me a few days ago , I said to them , which country in the world has such a large construction scale at present ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] With regard to the issue of the RMB exchange rate , to calculate based on PPP Standards , the total economic value and the construction scale of China should be absolutely far more than this .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] In the whole year of 2006 , the total investment in fixed assets of our country may reach 10 trillion yuan , increasing by approximately 30 % compared with the previous year .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] For example , Beijing plans to increase the length of its subway to 550 km by 2020 , which will surpass that of New York , the USA , to become the No. 1 in the world .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"However , at least several hundred billion yuan will be needed for this project .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Currently the investments in our country are mainly spent on three major areas including infrastructure , enterprise facilities and real estate .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Let 's look at infrastructure first .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In the example of Beijing Metro I mentioned above , the length of the subway in Beijing is less than 100 km at present , which is still far from 550 km .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] As for how many metros will be constructed in the whole country , there will be at least ten thousand kilometers .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] To calculate the cost at 500 million yuan per kilometer , an investment of five or six trillion yuan will be needed .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] In addition the construction of real estate can hardly cool down within two or three years .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The investment in real estate accounts for about 20 % of the total investment in fixed assets , and the investment amount this year is estimated to reach 18 trillion yuan , increasing by approximately 25 % year - on - year , but it is relatively low compared with other industries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] With an annual fund investment of more than one trillion yuan , construction of so many buildings is a piece of good news for improvement of Chinese people 's residence and office conditions .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Over the recent years , more than 300 million square meters of building area has been increased each year in our country , and per capita housing average has been increasing .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is estimated that China can basically step out of the housing bottleneck and enter into oversupply period in a few years .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] But in the area of enterprises , China has just started to catch up with developed countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] If the industrialization of our country in the 1980s and 1990s was only the industrialization in light industry and household electric appliance industry , then the industrialization in our country has entered into the stage of heavy chemical industry since the 21st century .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] These days , TV news is reporting that an enterprise in Shanxi has manufactured a large excavator for coal mining .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This shows that Chinese enterprises are finally starting to tackle large machinery .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Some news even said that China has started preparing to manufacture 100,000 - ton aircraft carriers .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact , in the field of ship building industry , China has already had the capacity and conditions to manufacture aircraft carriers .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Next , China will independently design and manufacture complete sets of equipment for large - scale enterprises in the heavy chemical industry .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Only when China is able to produce such large key equipment by itself can China reverse the development mode of mercantilism as well as get rid of the fate of being in the processing trade as the world factory .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] China is stepping into modernization , and high speed is needed by the development of the country .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As long as the development is reasonable , a growth rate of 10 % is not high .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] II. China 's economy is very "" heavy . """,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] At present the second feature of the economy in our country is "" heaviness , "" and such situation is caused by two major reasons .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] Firstly , our country is at the times of hardware construction and must be dealing with materials such as land , wood , steel and cement .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Secondly , our country is entering into the stage of heavy chemical industry development .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Two major sectors , "" knowledge - based industry "" and "" material - based industry , "" have emerged during the current world development .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] These years a saying has been circulating in our country that China has consumed 30 % of the steel , 40 % of the cement , and 30 % of the coal in the world but only has produced 4 % of its GDP .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Such feature has also resulted in soaring prices of energies and raw materials in the world in recent years .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] The international markets have been aware of China 's needs and taken this opportunity to raise prices .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Of course , China will go on with the development anyway , because there is in fact a considerable disparity between developed countries and us .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] We can see the disparity between our country and the US in hardware construction by giving an example .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In the 100 years of the last century , the US produced and consumed 8.4 billion metric tons of steel in total , but it was only 1.8 billion metric tons for our country .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The disparity between the two countries is more than 6 billion metric tons .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Both countries cover an area of more than 900 square kilometers , however the reinforced concrete cast in the US land might be several times more than in China in terms of the per capita amount , and it may take China many years to catch up with the infrastructure alone .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Even if China produces 500 million metric tons of steel each year in the future , it will still take about 15 - 20 years to fill the gap .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In particular , in terms of industrial structure , the developed countries have currently walked out of the stage of heavy chemical industry in succession , the industries in developed countries begin to become "" light , "" and their heavy chemical industries are gradually shifted to developing countries like China .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] China is in no position to pick and choose but take over the industries abandoned by others .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"This makes the industrial structure of China very "" heavy "" during the whole process of global division of labor .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] If China becomes the manufacture workshop of the world 's heavy chemical industry in the next 20 years , the outcome will be quite different from today .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] I recalled the year 2001 when the Internet craze and knowledge - based economy craze appeared at home and abroad , some people getting so excited believed that China could rely on the Internet alone in the future .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] I could n't help throwing cold water on them by writing an article , saying that China would still stay at the stage of civil construction and steel economy in the future .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In sum , dealing with material - based economy will be what Chinese people are going to do for a long historical stage in the future .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] China will face serious crisis of environment resources .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Therefore , China should take a two - way approach in the future by paying attention to both material - based industry and knowledge - based economy .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
[buabua] III. A relatively large wealth funnel exists in China 's economy .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Although the Chinese economy is growing rapidly , the distribution of national wealth is unbalanced , and a large disparity exists in the living conditions of citizens .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In particular , when compared internationally , people find that a relatively large wealth funnel exists in the growth of China 's economy .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] For example , in Japan and South Korea , the rapid economic growth lasted less than 20 years , and their annual growth rates were lower than China 's , but these countries very quickly entered the ranks of the developed countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In Japan during the period from the 1950s to the 1980s , the annual salary increase rate was 70 % higher than in the US , and the salary level had caught up with the US within less than 30 years .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Why has n't there been substantial change in the living conditions of most common people after nearly 30 years of reform ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In spite of the numerous skyscrapers under construction in various large cities today , some of those luxurious facilities have nothing to do with Chinese people .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] A lot of assets and wealth in China do not belong to Chinese people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] At present , the GDP -LRB- gross domestic product -RRB- of our country has reached over 20 trillion , but at least 40 % belongs to foreigners .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Thus , the phenomena of the high economic growth , the low income of people , and the large outflow of profits have emerged during the development of China .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In my opinion , the wealth funnel in China 's economic development lies in four areas .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Firstly , the large amount of exports has resulted in an outflow of resources and national wealth at a low price .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Secondly , the large introduction of foreign capital has also resulted in the large outflow of profits .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Thirdly , the huge amounts of unreported incomes derived from special rights and corruption are finding their way to foreign countries through diverse channels .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Fourthly , the low efficiency and low returns of state - owned enterprises have also wasted a large amount of national wealth .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] The problems in these four areas have caused the rapid development and quick loss of China 's economy at the same time .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Therefore , in a country that only pays attention to economic growth but neglects political reform , the effects of economic development will be questionable in the end .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] But today , this issue is just being put forward , and it will become clearer and more obvious in the future .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Regarding this point , some problems can be explained by providing only one figure .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] During the period of more than 20 years since the reform and opening - up , the unreported income from property rental has been a huge number .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In the 1990s , the economist Hu Heli et al. did the calculation and found that the discrepancies in prices , exchange currencies , and interests as well as other rentals amounted to 456.9 billion yuan in 1988 , accounting for 40 % of the GNP -LRB- 1,173.8 billion yuan -RRB- of that year .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] Recently , Gao Huiqing et al. of the State Information Center made the calculation and found that in 2004 the amount of rent from property rentals in the whole country reached 4.6 trillion yuan , accounting for 29 % of the GNP of that year , which was equivalent to 1.5 times the national fiscal revenue of that year , and 2.3 times the national salary income of that year .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] Since our country is a backward developing country , those who get rich first are always likely to migrate to developed countries .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] This has taken away a lot of wealth from our country .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] This has been the difference between the development of our country and the development of Japan and South Korea : a huge wealth funnel exists in the development of our country , but such funnel is very small in Japan and South Korea .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
[buabua] Only after overcoming these problems can China achieve quicker and better development .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] When the year 2006 is coming to the end , people always make various predictions for the next year .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] At the end of each year , I always have to deal with a large number of questionnaires provided by various news media and research institutions .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] Speaking about the speed of economy , I believe that China 's economy will not slow down in a short period .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[buabua] In 2007 , China 's economy will continue with the momentum of 2006 with an economic growth rate of no less than 9 % .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] For China , opportunities and challenges will coexist in 2007 .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] From the perspective of the world economy , the economy tends to be less active in some countries , providing an opportunity as well as a challenge to China .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] The world development is unbalanced today , just like in the 1930s , when the capitalist countries in Europe and America were in the Great Depression , it was the time for great economic development of the Soviet Union .",0,1,0,0,0,1,0
[buabua] China should grasp the opportunity and lose no time carrying out development .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] When energy prices are too high , causing some countries to slow down their economic growth , it might be the great time for the development of China .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] But in the new year , the trend of economic structure adjustment in our country will arrive inevitably .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] For China 's economy , the largest challenge is to adjust the "" strategy of earning foreign exchange "" which was established at the beginning of reform and opening - up more than 20 years ago , correct the inordinate development mode of mercantilism , and lay emphasis on domestic development .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] Such structure has brought prosperity to China but also has produced negative effects on China 's economy .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] At present , the foreign exchange reserve of our country has reached over one trillion US dollars .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If such development strategy is adopted for a long term , a huge international risk will exist in the foreign exchange reserve ; on the other hand , the living standard of Chinese people can hardly be improved .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] Therefore , putting forth great efforts to correct the development mode of our country after 2007 has become an important issue for the future .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
[buabua] The year 2007 should be a key year for China 's economic development .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] The high economic growth starting from 2003 is entering into the year 2007 , which will be a harvesting year for appraisal of achievements .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"[buabua] In this year , a lot of projects that were initiated some years ago will be completed and put into operation , and many other projects are winding up .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So the year 2007 will be a connecting link between the preceding and the following years .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
[buabua] China must ensure the stable economic development in 2007 in order to harvest the fruit of economic development .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Whether from the macroscopic and long - term perspective or from the short - term perspective of the 2008 Olympic Games , 2007 should be a year for assurance .",0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"In the last two years , regular account deficits in the U.S. averaged more than 800 billion dollars annually ; the U.S. accepted nearly 70 % of the earned surplus reserve of the world 's other countries , the equivalent of needing to bring in some 35 billion dollars per average business day in outside financial burden .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In a nutshell , the rebalancing plan the world so urgently needs is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix - that is , an improvement in the U.S. savings rate , which has been stagnant for a long time , and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -LRB- especially in Asia and the Middle East -RRB- .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"As for the United States , this will augur low exchange rates for the U.S. dollar , and an expansion of effective interest rates on U.S. - dollar capital .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Although as the end of the year approached the U.S. dollar dropped somewhat , and effective interest rates continued to climb , this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted by the framework of the rebalancing theory .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year 's National Assembly term extension , declaring the move null and void .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"This stirred the ire of National Assembly members , who struck back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , claiming that "" lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . """,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Activists in groups such as the Taipei Society and the Association of Taiwanese University Professors organized a street demonstration to call for the dissolution of the National Assembly .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
A further consequence of the grand justices ' ruling was that an election would have to be held to produce a new National Assembly membership before the conclusion of the current term .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"While this development had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling to launch election campaigns , by late March the post-presidential-election situation , combined with pressure from public opinion , pushed the KMT to work with the DPP on means to phase out the National Assembly , despite the KMT 's previous opposition to the body 's complete dissolution in the name of preserving the constitutional structure .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"For a time , the question of whether to hold elections for the National Assembly , as well as the DPP and KMT 's shared policy for phasing out the body , were viewed as motivated by fear of the growth of the People First Party -LRB- PFP -RRB- .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Thus the hubbub continued over the fate of the National Assembly for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed PFP caucus in the assembly agreed to its gradual downsizing .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"This paved the way for the commencement on April 8 of the sixth round of constitutional revisions in recent years , in which such issues as reducing the total number of NA delegates and freezing their powers and duties - amounting to their "" self - abolition "" - became the center of discussion .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The various parties leveraged their carrots and sticks against their delegates , threatening expulsion for not supporting the neutralization of the National Assembly at the same time as they tried to appease their delegates .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Finally , on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions , including deactivation of the National Assembly , favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan 's offshore islands -LRB- Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu -RRB- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices .",0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"In line with these revisions , the voting public will no longer directly elect NA delegates .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle the National Assembly , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the ROC .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"For example , the National Assembly will become a "" task - based body "" generated according to the proportion of seats held by each political party in the legislature .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"National Taiwan University professor Lee Hung - hsi , an expert on constitutional law , points out that less than 10 % of the Taiwanese population takes part in political party activities .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Huang Chun - ming 's use of fiction to express his concern for the elderly has a long history .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The title of "" An Irrational Old Man "" makes it plain that it too is a story about an elderly person .",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Here , however , Huang has written about a different sort of senior citizen , one who carries within himself a traditional wisdom uncorrupted by modern education .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In dialogue with his grandson Ah - ming , the "" Irrational Old Man "" passes on his old knowledge : listen to the sound of the waves the wind makes in the rice paddies to discover if the rice is ripe ; fill the bellies of grasshoppers with salt before grilling them ; sparrows are ghosts or spirits which understand human speech ; and killing the lu ti bird brings floods .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"At the end , the old man tells the boy of the spirit of the Choshui River , which searches for people to take its place .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In "" An Irrational Old Man , "" the reader feels very strongly that Huang Chun - ming is playing two roles : that of a little boy listening intently to his grandfather and that of a mature author who longs for the past and wishes to give voice to its earthy old knowledge .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Ah - sheng is the unforgettable elderly protagonist of "" Drowning an Old Cat , "" the next story in the collection .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Ah - sheng does n't have the life of ease of the "" Irrational Old Man , "" and he stubbornly resists the encroachment of his enemy , modern life .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In this tragic story , Ah - sheng is ultimately steamrollered by the massive momentum of the new .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But while the tragedy plays itself out , Huang makes it clear to the reader that he stands firmly on the side of Ah - sheng in this conflict .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Huang includes several comic and even farcical scenes , one of which occurs during a carnivalesque town meeting .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There , Ah - sheng demonstrates a startling ability to respond to circumstances and succeeds in wrecking the meeting hall as he makes an eloquent speech on the love of one 's family and birthplace , making "" the entire village jump to its feet in agitation . """,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This theme of tragedy resulting from changing times has appeared in Huang 's earlier work , in "" Cymbal , "" for example , which was strongly influenced by Lu Xun 's The Story of Ah Q .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Chin 's work - making announcements in the street while using a cymbal to attract attention - has been made obsolete by the spread of the megaphone , undercutting his social status and taking away his livelihood .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Chin thus takes on the role of a member of the older generation who has lost his struggle to make the transition to modern reality .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are reasons to look back to Huang 's early work .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first is to point out that Letting Them Go - in which the protagonist of every story is an elderly person - is entirely of a piece with his other work .,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact , it is a return to the main thread of his concerns of 30 years ago .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the extremely nationalistic atmosphere of the 1970s , Huang changed his focus for a time , writing about the hatred of Japan -LRB- Sayonara , Goodbye -RRB- and about anti-American sentiments -LRB- I Love Mary -RRB- .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"First , they lacked the fine composition of true literature .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Second , in them Huang had moved away from his greatest strength , the characters and settings with which he was truly familiar .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a result , Huang 's 1970s writings were simply records of the period in which they were written and creative experiments .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The second reason to look back at Huang 's early fiction is to highlight the continuity of Letting Them Go .,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Although it has been more than ten years since Huang 's last collection of fiction , and in spite of the fact that 37 years separate "" Cheng - tsai Gets off the Bus "" and "" Ticket Window , "" there is something at the core of Huang 's fiction which has not changed .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In his introduction to Letting Them Go , Huang mentions his deep distress at the plight of the elderly in Taiwan today , notes that he himself is just beginning to enter his twilight years , and compares Taiwan 's callous treatment of the elderly to the way in which the elderly were left to live or die on their own in the mountains in You Shan Jie Kao .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
All of this could very easily give the reader the mistaken impression that Huang 's vision of the elderly is a new development .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Letting Them Go , what we are actually seeing is the rebirth of Huang 's original passion .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If there has been any change in his portrayal of old people over the last 37 years , it is only in perspective .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Huang Chun - ming has often discussed the fact that he was raised largely by his grandparents , and that he had an unusually close relationship to them .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Each of Huang 's works describes a particular person or thing , and has an "" implied reader "" at which it is directed .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the past , Huang 's "" generation gap "" separated him from the people he was writing about - people of his grandparents ' generation , two generations removed from his own .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Another aspect of Huang 's work is that it presents many of the characteristics sociology attributes to relationships between people two generations removed from one another .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Viewing Huang 's fiction in this way , we can perhaps more clearly see wherein lies its charm .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Huang is never derisive or critical of his elderly characters .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we compare him to other Nativist writers who address the tragedy of the rural elderly unable to adapt to the modern industrial world , we note that Huang is reluctant to expose his elderly characters to unmitigated suffering .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Other Nativist writers use stories of suffering and pitiable elderly persons to make the case for reform .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Huang takes a much gentler approach - not because he thinks the modern world a perfect place , but because he can not bear to be so harsh .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Huang 's tender - heartedness is apparent to the reader of his work .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen Shui - bian have commented on the subject .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Last December , at a seminar at the Armed Forces University entitled "" Transmillennial National Security and Military Strategy , "" Lien delivered an address entitled "" National Defense Strategy and Construction in the New Century . """,1,0,1,1,0,1,0

"Obviously , after the experience of the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis , people in Taiwan have considered defending the island against mainland Chinese missile attack to be one of the foremost defense problems .",0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Interestingly , even as such "" pro-active defense "" ideas are being proposed , the Ministry of National Defense -LRB- MND -RRB- has made a seemingly contrary move : It has announced that military forces will be withdrawn from the remote offshore Pratas and Spratley islands , and that responsibility for these islands and for coastal patrolling will be transferred to the Coast Guard .",0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"The MND argues that since the military is being streamlined , in order to concentrate defense forces in Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu , the defense of the Pratas and Spratley islands - which are in the South China Sea - and the protection of coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left to the Coast Guard .",0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"Withdrawing from the two islands groups while moving actively to build a missile system may look like contradictory moves , but in fact they 're both part of the military blueprint for the future - the abandonment of initial use of military force , but the ability to retaliate when attacked .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"In announcing the ruling , Judicial Yuan Secretary - General Yang Jen - shou explained that the Executive Yuan 's decision to suspend construction of the nuclear plant was a major change in government policy , and since the premier is required to deliver a report to the legislature in such cases , Premier Chang 's failure to do so represents a procedural flaw .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
