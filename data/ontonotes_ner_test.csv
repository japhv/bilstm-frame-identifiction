After the Handover : Taiwan - Macau Relations in the New Millennium,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Last year , nearly one million travelers from Taiwan passed through Macau Airport , heading for mainland China or visiting Macau itself , and accounting for 80 % of passengers using the airport .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"As these results clearly indicate , the people of Taiwan still know little about Macau , in spite of existing exchanges , and more than half of them flatly reject Beijing 's "" one country two systems "" formula - so readily taken up in Macau - as a solution to the Taiwan question .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"This may not represent a very large share of Macau 's 17,000 civil servants , but given that many of those who graduated in Taiwan hold senior ranks , it adds something of a "" Taiwan flavor "" to the government of the Macau SAR -LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB- .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"However , for example , in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court , which is a separate body , but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also , the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"However , I think that the image that we Europeans had , of the American system and especially of the US Supreme Court , was that those justices were above politics and , I think , that is also one of the bad surprises that this election is reserving to us Europeans is that finally your system is not as perfect as we were led to believe .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"However , our electoral system is so much more simple in the sense that we have separate elections for the Presidency , for Parliament , for our mayors and therefore usually most French voters are faced with the difficulty of choosing a little paper ballotenne with a name on it and putting that in an envelop and then put that in the urn , so there is a much less chance of error , at least , in our French system .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Hey , it is interesting there also , when we look at the idea of checks and balances in a non-partisan judiciary , in terms of the checks and balances , that actually originated in France .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Joab killed two men who were much better than he was .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Solomon then made Benaiah son of Jehoiada the commander of the army in Joab 's place .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Asa forced them to leave the country .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
King Asa also took away the right of his mother Maacah to be queen mother .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"The thunder scared the Philistines , and they became confused , so the Israelites defeated them in battle .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The men of Israel ran out of Mizpah and chased the Philistines all the way to Beth Car .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They killed Philistine soldiers all along the way .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
After this Samuel set up a special stone to help people remember what God did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Samuel put the stone between Mizpah and Shen and named the stone `` Stone of Help . '',1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Samuel said , `` The Lord helped us all the way to this place . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Philistines were defeated and did not enter the land of Israel again .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The Lord was against the Philistines during the rest of Samuel 's life .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Philistines had taken some cities from Israel , but the Israelites won them back .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They recovered those cities throughout the Philistine area , from Ekron to Gath .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Samuel led Israel all his life .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every year he traveled around the country .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He went to Bethel , Gilgal , and Mizpah and he judged the Israelites in all these places .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
But Samuel always went back to his home in Ramah .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
There he built an altar to the Lord and judged Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then David left and Jonathan went back to the town .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David went to the town named Nob to see Ahimelech the priest .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Ahimelech went out to meet David .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"He was afraid of David and asked , `` Why are you alone ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

And this is especially true today . '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There was no bread except the holy bread , so the priest gave David this bread .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Each day they took this bread away and put fresh bread in its place .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
One of Saul 's officers was there that day .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"He was Doeg the Edomite , the leader of Saul 's shepherds .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"David asked Ahimelech , `` Do you have a spear or sword here ?",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The priest answered , `` The only sword here is the sword of Goliath the Philistine .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is the sword you took from him when you killed him in the Valley of Elah .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"David said , `` Goliath 's sword -- there 's not another one like it .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That day David ran away from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Achish 's officers said , `` Is n't this David , the king of the land of Israel ?",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"They dance and sing this song about him : `` Saul has killed thousands of enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David paid close attention to what they said .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was afraid of King Achish of Gath , so he pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his officers .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"While David was with them , he acted like a crazy man .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Achish said to his officers , `` Look at the man !",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
All the Israelites met together and mourned his death .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They buried him at his home in Ramah .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then David moved to the Desert of Maon .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a very rich man living in Maon .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He had 3000 sheep and 1000 goats .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
That man was in Carmel taking care of some business .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This man 's name was Nabal .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He was from Caleb 's family .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Nabal 's wife was named Abigail .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"She was a wise and beautiful woman , but Nabal was a mean and cruel man .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
David was in the desert when he heard that Nabal was cutting the wool from his sheep .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David sent ten young men to talk to Nabal .,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He told them , `` Go to Carmel .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Find Nabal and tell him ' Hello ' for me . '',1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David gave them this message for Nabal : `` May you and your family be well and all that you own be well .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
We never took anything from your shepherds while they were at Carmel .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please do this for me , your friend David . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David 's men went to Nabal .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"They gave his message to Nabal , but Nabal said , `` Who is David ?",0,0,1,1,0,0,0
There are many slaves who have run away from their masters these days .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
David 's men went back and told him everything that Nabal had said .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"David 's response was , `` Put on your swords . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So David and his men put on their swords .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
About 400 men went with David while 200 of them stayed with the supplies .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of Nabal 's servants spoke to Nabal 's wife Abigail .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The servant said , `` David sent messengers from the desert to meet our master , but Nabal was rude to them .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David 's men were with us the whole time , and they never did anything wrong to us .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abigail quickly gathered up 200 loaves of bread , two full wine bags , five cooked sheep , about a bushel of cooked grain , about 2 quarts of raisins , and 200 cakes of pressed figs .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then Abigail told her servants , `` Go on .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
She met David and his men coming from the other direction .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David was saying , `` I protected Nabal 's property in the desert .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
I made sure not one of his sheep was missing .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I swear , I wo n't let even one man in Nabal 's family live until tomorrow morning . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"When she saw David , she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down with her face to the ground in front of him .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abigail fell at his feet and said , `` Sir , please let me talk to you .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Sir , do n't pay any attention to that worthless man , Nabal .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"His name means ' Foolish , ' and that is what he is .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As surely as the Lord lives and you as well , may your enemies and anyone else who wants to harm you be as cursed as Nabal is .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He will make you leader over Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"David answered Abigail , `` Praise the Lord , the God of Israel .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
You kept me from killing innocent people today .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As surely as the Lord , the God of Israel , lives , if you had n't come quickly to meet me , not one man in Nabal 's family would have lived until tomorrow morning .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then David accepted Abigail 's gifts .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abigail went back to Nabal , who was in the house .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
So Abigail told Nabal nothing until the next morning .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The next morning , Nabal was sober , so his wife told him everything .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"About ten days later , the Lord gave him a stroke and Nabal died .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , `` Praise the Lord !",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
The Lord kept me from doing wrong and made Nabal pay for what he did . '',1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then David sent a message to Abigail and asked her to be his wife .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His servants went to Carmel with this message , `` David sent us to get you .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abigail bowed her face to the ground .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Abigail quickly got on a donkey and brought five of her maids with her .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So Abigail became David 's wife .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Both Ahinoam and Abigail were David 's wives .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"David was also married to Saul 's daughter Michal , but Saul had taken her away from him and had given her to a man named Palti , son of Laish .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Palti was from the town named Gallim .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Meanwhile , the Philistines fought against the Israelites , and the Israelites ran from them .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
There were many dead bodies that fell at Mount Gilboa .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The Philistines fought hard against Saul and his sons .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They killed Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malki Shua .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
The battle grew even more intense around Saul .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The archers closed in on Saul and wounded him with many arrows .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Saul told the boy who carried his armor , `` Take your sword and kill me or else these foreigners will do it and torment me as well ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Saul 's helper was afraid and refused to kill him .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
So Saul took out his own sword and fell on it .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the helper saw that Saul was dead , he took out his own sword , fell on it , and died there with Saul .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So Saul , his three sons , and the boy who carried his armor all died together that day .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Israelites who lived on the other side of the valley saw the Israelite army running away .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They saw that Saul and his sons were dead , so they left their cities and ran away .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then the Philistines came and lived in their cities .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The next day , the Philistines went back to take things from the dead bodies .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa .,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
The Philistines cut off Saul 's head and took all his armor .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They carried the news to the Philistines and to all the temples of their idols .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They put Saul 's armor in the temple of Ashtoreth .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Philistines also hung Saul 's body on the wall of Beth Shan .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people living in Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines did to Saul .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So all the soldiers of Jabesh went to Beth Shan .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They marched all night , went to the wall of Beth Shan , and took down the bodies of Saul and his sons .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then they carried them to Jabesh .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
There the people of Jabesh burned the bodies of Saul and his three sons .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Later , they buried the bones of Saul and his three sons under the big tree in Jabesh .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then the people of Jabesh showed their sadness -- they did not eat for seven days .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The boy Samuel was Eli 's helper and served the Lord with him .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
One night he went to his room to go to bed .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The special lamp in the temple was still burning , so Samuel lay down in the temple near where the Holy Box was .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Again the Lord called , `` Samuel ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again Samuel ran to Eli and said , `` Here I am .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
Samuel did not yet know the Lord because the Lord had not spoken directly to him before .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Lord called Samuel the third time .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again Samuel got up and went to Eli and said , `` Here I am .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Eli told Samuel , `` Go to bed .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

So Samuel went back to bed .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He called as he did before , saying , `` Samuel , Samuel ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Lord said to Samuel , `` I will soon do things in Israel that will shock anyone who hears about them .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why I swore an oath that sacrifices and offerings will never take away the sins of the people in Eli 's family . '',0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Samuel lay down in bed until the morning came .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Eli said to Samuel , `` Samuel , my son . ''",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Samuel answered , `` Yes , sir . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Lord was with Samuel while he grew up .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He did not let any of Samuel 's messages prove false .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Then all Israel , from Dan to Beersheba , knew that Samuel was a true prophet of the Lord .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Lord continued to appear to Samuel at Shiloh .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He revealed himself to Samuel as the word of the Lord .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David left Gath and ran away to the cave of Adullam .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

David left Adullam and went to Mizpah in Moab .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David said to the king of Moab , `` Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God is going to do to me . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

They stayed with the king of Moab as long as David was at the fort .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the prophet Gad said to David , `` Do n't stay in the fort .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Saul heard the report about David and his men while sitting under the tree on the hill at Gibeah .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Saul had his spear in his hand .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

None of you told me about my son Jonathan and the agreement he made with the son of Jesse .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
None of you cares enough about me to tell me that my own son Jonathan encouraged David to turn against me and attack me .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is what David is doing now . '',1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Doeg the Edomite was standing there with Saul 's officers .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

David came to see Ahimelech son of Ahitub .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Ahimelech prayed to the Lord for David and gave him some food .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Ahimelech answered , `` David is very faithful to you .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Not one of your other officers is as faithful as David .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was not the first time I prayed to God for David .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the king said , `` Ahimelech , you and all your relatives must die . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Then the king told the guards at his side , `` Go and kill the priests of the Lord because they are on David 's side too .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the king gave the order to Doeg .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Saul said , `` Doeg , you go kill the priests . ''",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
That day he killed 85 men who were priests .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Doeg killed all the people of Nob .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"After Saul had chased the Philistines away , people told him , `` David is in the desert area near En Gedi . ''",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
So Saul chose 3000 men from all over Israel and began searching for David and his men .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They looked near Wild Goat Rocks .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
David and his men were deep inside that same cave .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David 's men told him , `` This is day the Lord told you about when he said , ' I will give your enemy to you , and you can do whatever you want to him . ' ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Saul did n't notice what happened .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Later , David felt bad about what he did .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I must not do anything against Saul , because he is the Lord 's chosen king . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
David said these things to stop his men .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He would not let his men hurt Saul .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Later , David came out of the cave and called out to Saul , `` My lord the king ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
David bowed with his face to the ground to show his respect .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Saul is the Lord 's chosen king . ',0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Did the king of Israel bring an army to chase a single flea or a dying dog ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When David finished speaking , Saul asked , `` Is that your voice , David my son ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

May the Lord reward you for being good to me today .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
You will rule the kingdom of Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

David and his men went back up to the fort .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

David 's men fought the Philistines .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He put the Holy Box at the house of Obed Edom from Gath .,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
The Lord 's Holy Box stayed in Obed Edom 's house for three months .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

David put up a tent for the Holy Box .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

A person could buy a basket of fine flour or two baskets of barley for only one shekel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

That year Hoshea did not pay tribute to the king of Assyria as he did every other year .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The king of Assyria learned that Hoshea had made plans against him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So he arrested Hoshea and put him in jail .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The king of Assyria attacked many places in Israel .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then he came to Samaria and fought against it for three years .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The king of Assyria took Samaria during the ninth year that Hoshea was king of Israel .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it was the Lord who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt !,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He saved them from the power of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the Lord had forced those people to leave their land when the Israelites came .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The Lord used every prophet and every seer to warn Israel and Judah .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He said , `` Turn away from the evil things you do .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They made two gold statues of calves .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They worshiped all the stars of heaven and served Baal .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the Lord became very angry with Israel and removed them from his sight .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There were no Israelites left , except the tribe of Judah .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But even the people of Judah did not obey the commands of the Lord their God .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They lived just as the Israelites had .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The Lord tore them from the family of David , and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jeroboam pulled the Israelites away from following the Lord .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the Israelites sinned in all the ways Jeroboam did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they did not stop committing these sins until the Lord took Israel away from his sight .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So the Israelites were taken out of their country into Assyria .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"The king of Assyria took the Israelites out of Samaria and brought in other people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Hezekiah gave all the silver that was in the Lord 's Temple and in the king 's treasuries .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

"But he said , ' Wash , and you will be pure and clean . ' ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Naaman did what the man of God said .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He went down and dipped himself in the Jordan River seven times , and he became pure and clean .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He stood before Elisha and said , `` Look , I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel .",0,0,1,1,0,0,0

"Naaman tried hard to make Elisha take the gift , but he refused .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then Naaman said , `` If you will not accept this gift , at least do this for me .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me have enough dirt from Israel to fill the baskets on two of my mules .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Then Elisha said to Naaman , `` Go in peace . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Naaman left Elisha and went a short way .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said , `` Look , my master has let Naaman the Aramean go without accepting the gift that he brought .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"As the Lord lives , I will run after Naaman and get something from him . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He stepped down from the chariot to meet Gehazi .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Naaman said , `` Is everything all right ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gehazi said , `` Yes , everything is all right .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Please give them 75 pounds of silver and two changes of clothes . ' '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Naaman said , `` Please , take 150 pounds . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He persuaded Gehazi to take the silver .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Naaman put 150 pounds of silver in two bags and took two changes of clothes .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then he gave these things to two of his servants .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The servants carried these things for Gehazi .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"When Gehazi came to the hill , he took these things from the servants .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Gehazi came in and stood before his master .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Elisha said to Gehazi , `` Where have you been Gehazi ? ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Gehazi answered , `` I did n't go anywhere . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Elisha said to him , `` That is not true !",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Now you and your children will catch Naaman 's disease .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Gehazi left Elisha , his skin was as white as snow !",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The group of prophets said to Elisha , `` We are staying in that place over there , but it is too small for us .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let 's go to the Jordan River and cut some wood .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"One of them said , `` Please go with us . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So Elisha went with the group of prophets .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they arrived at the Jordan River , they began to cut down some trees .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But when one man was cutting down a tree , the iron ax head slipped from the handle and fell into the water .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The man showed Elisha the place where the ax head fell .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Elisha cut a stick and threw the stick into the water .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elisha said , `` So pick up the ax head . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The king of Aram was making war against Israel .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
But the man of God sent a message to the king of Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Elisha said , `` Be careful !",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The king of Israel sent a message to his men at the place that the man of God warned him about .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the king of Israel saved quite a few men .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The king of Aram was very upset about this .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"He called his army officers and said to them , `` Tell me who is spying for the king of Israel . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

They arrived at night and surrounded the city .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Elisha 's servant got up early that morning .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Then Elisha prayed and said , `` Lord , I ask you , open my servant 's eyes so that he can see . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
These horses and chariots of fire came down to Elisha .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then the Lord did what Elisha asked .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He caused the Aramean army to become blind .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Elisha said to the Aramean army , `` This is not the right way .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then Elisha led them to Samaria .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they arrived at Samaria , Elisha said , `` Lord , open the eyes of these men so that they can see . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then the Lord opened their eyes , and the Aramean army saw they were in the city of Samaria !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Give the Aramean army some bread and water .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The king of Israel prepared much food for the Aramean army .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The Arameans did not send any more soldiers into the land of Israel to make raids .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"After this happened , King Ben-Hadad of Aram gathered all his army and went to surround and attack the city of Samaria .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The soldiers would not let people bring food into the city , so there was a time of terrible hunger in Samaria .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
It was so bad in Samaria that a donkey 's head was sold for 80 pieces of silver and one pint of dove 's dung sold for five pieces of silver .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
The king of Israel was walking on the wall around the city .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The king of Israel said , `` If the Lord does not help you , how can I help you ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Amaziah son of King Joash of Judah became king in the second year that Jehoash son of Jehoahaz was king of Israel .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Amaziah was 25 years old when he began to rule .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He ruled 29 years in Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
His mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Amaziah did what the Lord said was right , but he did not follow God completely like David his ancestor .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Amaziah did everything that Joash his father had done .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"At the time that Amaziah had strong control of the kingdom , he killed the officers who had killed his father .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

King Jehoash of Israel sent an answer to King Amaziah of Judah .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jehoash said , `` The thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar tree in Lebanon .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But a wild animal from Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thornbush .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If you do this , you will fall , and Judah will fall with you ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Amaziah would not listen to Jehoash 's warning .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
So King Jehoash of Israel went to fight against King Amaziah of Judah at Beth Shemesh in Judah .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Every man of Judah ran home .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"At Beth Shemesh , King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah of Judah , the son of Joash , the son of Ahaziah .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Then Jehoash took all the gold and silver and all the dishes in the Lord 's Temple and in the treasures of the king 's palace .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jehoash also took people to be his prisoners .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then he went back to Samaria .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"All the great things that Jehoash did , including how he fought against King Amaziah of Judah , are written in the book , The History of the Kings of Israel .",1,0,1,1,0,0,0

The people brought Amaziah 's body back on horses .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He was buried at Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then all the people of Judah made Azariah the new king .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So King Amaziah died and was buried with his ancestors .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Azariah rebuilt Elath and got it back for Judah .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
King Jeroboam son of Jehoash of Israel began to rule in Samaria during the 15th year that Amaziah son of Joash was king of Judah .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Jeroboam did what the Lord said was wrong .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He did not stop committing the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat who caused Israel to sin .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jeroboam took back Israel 's land , which ran from the Lebo Hamath to the Arabah Sea .",1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"The Lord saw that all the Israelites , both slaves and free men , had many troubles .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
No one was left who could help Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The Lord did not say that he would take away the name of Israel from the world .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So he used Jeroboam son of Jehoash to save the Israelites .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All the great things that Jeroboam did are written in the book , The History of the Kings of Israel .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

King Josiah told all the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem to come and meet with him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
All the people of Judah and the people who lived in Jerusalem went with him .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then he read the Book of the Agreement .,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
This was the Book of the Law that was found in the Lord 's Temple .,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Josiah read the book so that all the people could hear it .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest , the other priests , and the gatekeepers to bring out of the Lord 's Temple all the dishes and things that were made to honor Baal , Asherah , and the stars of heaven .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Josiah burned those things outside Jerusalem in the fields in Kidron Valley .,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
Then they carried the ashes to Bethel .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The kings of Judah had chosen some ordinary men to serve as priests .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
These false priests were burning incense at the high places in every city of Judah and all the towns around Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They burned incense to honor Baal , the sun , the moon , the constellations , and all the stars in the sky .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Josiah stopped those false priests .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah removed the Asherah pole from the Lord 's Temple .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He took the Asherah pole outside the city to the Kidron Valley and burned it there .,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
Then King Josiah broke down the houses of the male prostitutes who were in the Lord 's Temple .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Women also used these houses and made little tent covers to honor the false goddess Asherah .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
At that time the priests did not bring the sacrifices to Jerusalem and offer them on the altar in the Temple .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The priests lived in cities all over Judah .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The high places were everywhere , from Geba to Beersheba .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
And the priests ate their unleavened bread in those towns with the ordinary people -- not at the special place for priests in the Temple in Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But King Josiah ruined the high places and brought the priests to Jerusalem .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Josiah also destroyed the high places that were on the left side of the city gate , by the Gate of Joshua .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
-LRB- Joshua was the ruler of the city . -RRB-,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Topheth was a place in the Valley of Hinnom 's Son where people killed their children and burned them on an altar to honor the false god Molech .,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah ruined that place so that no one could use it again .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
In the past the kings of Judah had put some horses and a chariot near the entrance to the Lord 's Temple .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was near the room of an important official named Nathan Melech .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

But King Josiah ruined all these places of worship .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He broke all the memorial stones and Asherah poles .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah also broke down the altar and high place at Bethel .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Jeroboam son of Nebat had made this altar .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah broke down both that altar and the high place .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then he beat it into dust and he burned the Asherah pole .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah looked around and saw graves on the mountain .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
In this way Josiah ruined the altar .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The man of God announced these things when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the feast .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Josiah looked around and saw the grave of the man of God .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Josiah said , `` What is that monument I see ? ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The people of the city told him , `` It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
This man of God told about the things you have done to the altar at Bethel .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Josiah said , `` Leave the man of God alone .",0,0,1,1,0,0,0
So they left his bones and the bones of the man of God from Samaria .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Josiah also destroyed all the temples at the high places in the cities of Samaria .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The kings of Israel had built those temples , which had made the Lord very angry .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Josiah destroyed them , just as he had destroyed the place of worship at Bethel .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Josiah killed all the priests of the high places that were in Samaria .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then he went back to Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then King Josiah gave a command to all the people .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do this just as it is written in the Book of the Agreement . '',0,0,0,1,0,0,0
The people had not celebrated a Passover like this since the days when the judges ruled Israel .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
None of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah ever had such a big celebration for Passover .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They celebrated this Passover for the Lord in Jerusalem during Josiah 's 18th year as king .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Josiah destroyed the mediums , wizards , the house gods , the idols , and all the horrible things people worshiped in Judah and Jerusalem .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He did this to obey the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the Lord 's Temple .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
There had never been a king like Josiah before .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Josiah turned to the Lord with all his heart , with all his soul , and with all his strength .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
No king had followed all the Law of Moses like Josiah .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there has never been another king like Josiah since that time .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the Lord did not stop being angry with the people of Judah .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
He was still angry with them for everything that Manasseh had done .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Lord said , `` I forced the Israelites to leave their land .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I will do the same to Judah .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Josiah 's officers put his body in a chariot and carried him from Megiddo to Jerusalem .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They buried Josiah in his own grave .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
He ruled three months in Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Pharaoh Neco forced Judah to pay 7500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Pharaoh Neco made Josiah 's son Eliakim the new king .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Eliakim took the place of Josiah his father .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pharaoh Neco changed Eliakim 's name to Jehoiakim .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And Pharaoh Neco took Jehoahaz away to Egypt where he died .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Joash hid there for six years .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Jehoiada also made the agreement between the king and the people .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then all the people went to the temple of Baal .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They destroyed the statue of Baal and his altars .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They also killed Baal 's priest , Mattan , in front of the altars .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Jehoiada the priest put men in charge of maintaining the Lord 's Temple .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then King Joash sat on the throne .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Queen Athaliah was killed with a sword near the king 's palace .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Joash was seven years old when he became king .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will be punished on the day when God will show his anger .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
On that day everyone will see how right God is to judge people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil -- to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But he will give glory , honor , and peace to everyone who does good -- to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Those who are not Jews do n't have the law .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
All this will happen on the day when God will judge people 's secret thoughts through Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is part of the Good News that I tell everyone .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
You say you are a Jew .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As the Scriptures say , `` People in other nations insult God because of you . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those who are not Jews are not circumcised .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
You are not a true Jew if you are only a Jew in your physical body .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
A true Jew is one who is a Jew inside .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is done by the Spirit , not by the written law .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And anyone who is circumcised in the heart by the Spirit gets praise from God , not from people .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ Jesus when we were baptized ?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"So when we were baptized , we were buried with Christ and took part in his death .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And just as Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father , so we can now live a new life .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

All these commands and all other commands are really only one rule :,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Surely you know what the Scriptures say about Elijah .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Scriptures tell about Elijah praying to God against the people of Israel .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what answer did God give to Elijah ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"God said , `` I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have never given worship to Baal . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So this is what has happened : The people of Israel wanted God 's blessing , but they did not all get it .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"So I ask : When the Jews fell , did that fall destroy them ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But their mistake brought salvation to those who are not Jews .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The purpose of this was to make the Jews jealous .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And what they lost brought rich blessings to the non-Jewish people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So surely the world will get much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Now I am speaking to you people who are not Jews .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I am an apostle to the non-Jewish people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
God turned away from the Jews .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

But you non-Jewish people are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The truth is this : Part of Israel has been made stubborn , but that will change when enough non-Jewish people have come to God .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Glory forever to the only wise God through Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what can we say about Abraham , the father of our people ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Abraham was made right by the things he did , he had a reason to boast about himself .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That 's why the Scriptures say , `` Abraham believed God , and because of this he was accepted as one who is right with God . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David said the same thing when he was talking about the blessing people have when God accepts them as good without looking at what they have done : `` It is a great blessing when people are forgiven for the wrongs they have done , when their sins are erased !",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have already said that it was because of Abraham 's faith that he was accepted as one who is right with God .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised ?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham was circumcised later to show that God accepted him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is their father only if they live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Abraham did not receive that promise because he followed the law .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And God 's promise to Abraham is worthless , because the law can only bring God 's anger on those who disobey it .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if the promise is a free gift , then all of Abraham 's people will get that promise .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The promise is not just for those who live under the Law of Moses .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is for all who live with faith as Abraham did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the Scriptures say , `` I have made you a father of many nations . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is true before God , the one Abraham believed -- the God who gives life to the dead and speaks of things that do n't yet exist as if they are real .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was no hope that Abraham would have children , but Abraham believed God and continued to hope .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As God told him , `` You will have many descendants . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abraham was almost a hundred years old , so he was past the age for having children .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also , Sarah could not have children .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abraham was well aware of this , but his faith in God never became weak .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he promised .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
These words -LRB- `` he was accepted '' -RRB- were written not only for Abraham .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
We believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from death .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus was handed over to die for our sins , and he was raised from death to make us right with God .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Each one of us has one body , and that body has many parts .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the same way , we are many people , but in Christ we are all one body .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As the Scriptures say about him , `` Those people who insulted you have also insulted me . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That hope comes from the patience and encouragement that the Scriptures give us .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I pray that God will help you all agree with each other , as Christ Jesus wants .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And all together you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God has done what he promised their great ancestors .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Christ also did this so that the non-Jewish people could praise God for the mercy he gives to them .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The Scriptures say , `` So I will give thanks to you among the people of other nations ; I will sing praise to your name . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the Scriptures say , `` You people of other nations should be happy together with God 's people . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Scriptures also say , `` Praise the Lord all you people of other nations ; all people should praise the Lord . ''",1,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Then you will have more and more hope , and it will flow out of you by the power of the Holy Spirit .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I did this because God gave me this special gift : to be a servant of Christ Jesus for those who are not Jews .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He gave me this work so that you non-Jewish people could be an offering that he will accept -- an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is why I feel so good about what I have done for God in my service to Christ Jesus .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
I will talk only about what Christ has done with me in leading the non-Jewish people to obey God .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And they obeyed him because of the power of the miraculous signs and wonders that happened -- all because of the power of God 's Spirit .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
I have told people the Good News about Christ in every place from Jerusalem to Illyricum .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I always want to tell the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But as the Scriptures say , `` Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard about him will understand . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And for many years I have wanted to visit you .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So I will visit you when I go to Spain .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes , I hope to visit you while I am traveling to Spain , and I will stay and enjoy being with you .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God 's people there .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Some of them are poor , and the believers in Macedonia and Achaia wanted to help them .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And it was like paying something they owed them , because as non-Jews they have been blessed spiritually by the Jews .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So now they should use the material blessings they have to help the Jews .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I am going to Jerusalem to make sure the poor get this money that has been given for them .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"After I finish that , I will leave for Spain and stop to visit you on the way .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know that when I visit you , I will bring you Christ 's full blessing .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Spirit gives us .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Pray that I will be saved from those in Judea who refuse to accept our message .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And pray that this help I am bringing to Jerusalem will please God 's people there .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So now anyone who is in Christ Jesus is not judged guilty .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
That is because in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you free .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about what the Spirit wants them to do .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But if your thinking is controlled by the Spirit , there is life and peace .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"You are ruled by the Spirit , if that Spirit of God really lives in you .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
But whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But if Christ is in you , then the Spirit gives you life , because Christ made you right with God .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And if God 's Spirit lives in you , he will also give life to your bodies that die .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Yes , God is the one who raised Christ from death , and he will raise you to life through his Spirit living in you .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But if you use the Spirit 's help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body , you will have true life .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Spirit that we received is not a spirit that makes us slaves again and causes us to fear .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The Spirit that we have makes us God 's chosen children .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And with that Spirit we cry out , `` Abba , Father . ''",0,0,1,0,1,0,0
And the Spirit himself speaks to our spirits and makes us sure that we are God 's children .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
But we must suffer like Christ suffered .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
We have the Spirit as the first part of God 's promise .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Also , the Spirit helps us .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We are very weak , but the Spirit helps us with our weakness .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We do n't know how to pray as we should , but the Spirit himself speaks to God for us .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And he understands what the Spirit is saying , because the Spirit speaks for his people in the way that agrees with what God wants .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So now with Jesus , God will surely give us all things .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Christ Jesus died for us , but that is not all .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Can anything separate us from Christ 's love ?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"As the Scriptures say , `` For you we are in danger of death all the time .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am sure that nothing now , nothing in the future , no powers , nothing above us or nothing below us -- nothing in the whole created world -- will ever be able to separate us from the love God has shown us in Christ Jesus our Lord .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Some people might believe that one day is more important than another .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And others might believe that every day is the same .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is why Christ died and rose from death to live again -- so that he could be Lord over those who have died and those who are living .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So why do you judge your brother or sister in Christ ?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Yes , the Scriptures say , `` ' As surely as I live , ' says the Lord , ' Everyone will bow before me ; everyone will say that I am God . ' ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Lord Jesus is the one who convinced me of that .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here is what is important : a right way of life , peace , and joy -- all from the Holy Spirit .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Through our faith , Christ has brought us into that blessing of God 's grace that we now enjoy .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
We know this because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts through the Holy Spirit he gave us .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
We have been made right with God by the blood sacrifice of Christ .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I mean that while we were God 's enemies , he made friends with us through his Son 's death .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And the fact that we are now God 's friends makes it even more certain that he will save us through his Son 's life .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And not only will we be saved , but we also rejoice right now in what God has done for us through our Lord Jesus Christ .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is because of Jesus that we are now God 's friends .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sin came into the world because of what one man did .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , everyone had to die .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Adam died because he sinned by not obeying God 's command .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That one man , Adam , can be compared to Christ , the one who was coming in the future .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But God 's free gift is not like Adam 's sin .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Many people died because of the sin of that one man .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Many received God 's gift of life by the grace of this other man , Jesus Christ .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After Adam sinned once , he was judged guilty .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One man sinned , and so death ruled all people because of that one man .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Surely they will have true life and rule through the one man , Jesus Christ .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
One man disobeyed God and many became sinners .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But in the same way , one man obeyed God and many will be made right .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The law was brought in so that more people would sin the way Adam did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this brings us eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Greetings from Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
God promised long ago through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures to give this Good News to his people .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The Good News is about God 's Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"As a human , he was born from the family of David , but through the Holy Spirit he was shown to be God 's powerful Son when he was raised from death .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

You are some of those who have been chosen to belong to Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This letter is to all of you in Rome .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would like to see the same good result among you that I have had from my work among the other non-Jewish people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I must serve all people -- those who share in Greek culture and those who are less civilized , the educated as well as the ignorant .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is why I want so much to tell the Good News to you there in Rome .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I am proud of the Good News , because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes -- to save the Jews first , and now to save those who are not Jews .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"As the Scriptures say , `` The one who is right with God by faith will live forever . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So , do Jews have anything that others do n't have ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes , the Jews have many benefits .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The most important one is this : God trusted the Jews with his teachings .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is true that some Jews were not faithful to God .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As the Scriptures say about him , `` You will be proved right in what you say , and you will win when people accuse you . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So are we Jews better than other people ?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"No , we have already said that those who are Jews , as well as those who are not Jews , are the same .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As the Scriptures say , `` There is no one doing what is right , not even one .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
God makes people right through their faith in Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are made right with God by being made free from sin through Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
God gave Jesus as a way to forgive people 's sins through their faith in him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
God can forgive them because the blood sacrifice of Jesus pays for their sins .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
God gave Jesus to show that he always does what is right and fair .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He is Jesus , who saves us from God 's angry judgment that is coming .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
We told you about the power of our Lord Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No , we saw the greatness of Jesus with our own eyes .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus heard the voice of the great and glorious God .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It came from heaven while we were with Jesus on the holy mountain .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have that light until the day begins and the morning star brings new light to your minds .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Most important of all , you must understand this : No prophecy in the Scriptures comes from the prophet 's own understanding .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But people were led by the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But he saved Noah and seven other people with him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Noah was a man who told people about living right .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
God also punished the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

"But do n't forget this one thing , dear friends : To the Lord a day is like a thousand years , and a thousand years is like a day .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the day when the Lord comes again will surprise everyone like the coming of a thief .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the earth and everything in it will be burned up .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Our dear brother Paul told you that same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They also give wrong meanings to the other Scriptures .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was the Lord Jesus who first told people about it .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he proved it by giving people various gifts through the Holy Spirit in just the way he wanted .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is written some place in the Scriptures , `` Why are people so important to you ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For a short time Jesus was made lower than the angels , but now we see him wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because of God 's grace , Jesus died for everyone .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He made Jesus a perfect Savior through his suffering .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus , the one who makes people holy , and those who are made holy are from the same family .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Jesus himself became like them and had the same experiences they have .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus did this so that , by dying , he could destroy the one who has the power of death -- the devil .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus became like these people and died so that he could free them .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Clearly , it is not angels that Jesus helps .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He helps the people who are from Abraham .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For this reason , Jesus had to be made like us , his brothers and sisters , in every way .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Continue loving each other as brothers and sisters in Christ .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And those priests who serve in the Holy Tent can not eat from the sacrifice we have .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
So Jesus also suffered outside the city .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we should go to Jesus outside the camp and accept the same shame that he had .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So through Jesus we should never stop offering our sacrifice to God .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"God is the one who raised from death our Lord Jesus , the Great Shepherd of his sheep .",1,0,0,0,0,1,0
He raised him because Jesus sacrificed his blood to begin the new agreement that never ends .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I pray that God will work through Jesus Christ to do the things in us that please him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to know that our brother Timothy is out of prison .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
All those from Italy send you their greetings .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Cain and Abel both offered sacrifices to God .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
But Abel offered a better sacrifice to God because he had faith .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
God said he was pleased with what Abel offered .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Enoch was carried away from this earth , so he never died .",0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Scriptures tell us that before he was carried off , he was a man who pleased God .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Noah was warned by God about things that he could not yet see .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With his faith , Noah showed that the world was wrong .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he became one of those who are made right with God through faith .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
God called Abraham to travel to another place that he promised to give him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham did not know where that other place was .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham lived in the country that God promised to give him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who also received the same promise from God .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham was waiting for the city that has real foundations .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sarah was not able to have children , and Abraham was too old .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham was so old he was almost dead .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But from that one man came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
God told him to offer Isaac as a sacrifice .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham obeyed because he had faith .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And God had already said to him , `` It is through Isaac that your descendants will come . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But Abraham was ready to offer his only son .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And really , when God stopped Abraham from killing Isaac , it was as if he got him back from death .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Jacob , also because he had faith , blessed each one of Joseph 's sons .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when Joseph was almost dead , he spoke about the people of Israel leaving Egypt .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the mother and father of Moses hid him for three months after he was born .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He thought it was better to suffer for the Christ than to have all the treasures of Egypt .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Moses left Egypt because he had faith .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doorways of the people of Israel , so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And God 's people all walked through the Red Sea as if it were dry land .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But when the Egyptians tried to follow them , they were drowned .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the walls of Jericho fell because of the faith of God 's people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They marched around the walls for seven days , and then the walls fell .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And Rahab , the prostitute , welcomed the Israelite spies like friends .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do n't have enough time to tell you about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
But not one of them received God 's great promise .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Melchizedek was the king of Salem and a priest for God the Most High .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
He met Abraham when Abraham was coming back after defeating the kings .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The name Melchizedek , king of Salem , has two meanings .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"First , Melchizedek means `` king of justice . ''",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And `` king of Salem '' means `` king of peace . '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Melchizedek is like the Son of God in that he will always be a priest .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
You can see that Melchizedek was very great .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Abraham , our great ancestor , gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the law says that those from the tribe of Levi who become priests must get a tenth from their own people , even though they and their people are both from the family of Abraham .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Melchizedek was not even from the tribe of Levi , but Abraham gave him a tenth of what he had .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
And Melchizedek blessed Abraham -- the one who had God 's promises .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those priests get a tenth , but they are only men who live and then die .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But Melchizedek , who got a tenth from Abraham , continues to live , as the Scriptures say .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Now those from the family of Levi are the ones who get a tenth from the people .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But we can say that when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth , then Levi also paid it .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Levi was not yet born , but he already existed in his ancestor Abraham when Melchizedek met him .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I mean a priest like Melchizedek , not Aaron .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
It is clear that Christ came from the tribe of Judah .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
And these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like Melchizedek .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
This is what the Scriptures say about him : `` You are a priest forever -- the kind of priest Melchizedek was . '',1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also , it is important that God made a promise with an oath when he made Jesus high priest .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So this means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from God to his people .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So Jesus is the kind of high priest we need .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They had to offer sacrifices every day , first for their own sins , and then for the sins of the people .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But Jesus does n't need to do that .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He offered only one sacrifice for all time .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As God said , `` I was angry and made a promise : ' They will never enter my place of rest . ' ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes , somewhere in the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said , `` So on the seventh day God rested from all his work . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But those who first heard the good news about it did not enter , because they did not obey .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is called `` today . '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He spoke about that day through David a long time later using the words we quoted before : `` If you hear God 's voice today , do n't be stubborn . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know that Joshua did not lead the people into the place of rest that God promised .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
We know this because God spoke later about another day for rest .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
This shows that the seventh - day rest for God 's people is still to come .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
He is Jesus the Son of God .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus , our high priest , is able to understand our weaknesses .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Jesus lived on earth , he was tempted in every way .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With Jesus as our high priest , we can feel free to come before God 's throne where there is grace .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent : `` Be sure to make everything exactly like the pattern I showed you on the mountain . '',1,1,0,0,0,0,0
But the work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to those priests .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was told that some of the Jews were making a plan to kill him .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
I also told those Jews to tell you what they have against him .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Then Paul and those with him traveled through other cities .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They gave the believers the rules and decisions from the apostles and elders in Jerusalem .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
So the churches were becoming stronger in the faith and were growing bigger every day .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Paul and those with him went through the areas of Phrygia and Galatia because the Holy Spirit did not allow them to tell the Good News in the province of Asia .,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

"After Jesus said these things , he felt very troubled .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said openly , `` Believe me when I say that one of you will hand me over to my enemies . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They did not understand who Jesus was talking about .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the followers was next to Jesus and was leaning close to him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was the one Jesus loved very much .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Simon Peter made signs to this follower to ask Jesus who he was talking about .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked , `` Lord , who is it ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered him , `` I will dip this bread into the dish .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So Jesus took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Judas took the bread , Satan entered him .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said to Judas , `` What you will do -- do it quickly ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since Judas was the one in charge of the money , some of them thought that Jesus meant for him to go and buy some things they needed for the feast .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Or they thought that Jesus wanted him to go give something to the poor .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Judas ate the bread Jesus gave him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Judas was gone , Jesus said , `` Now is the time for the Son of Man to receive his glory .",1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Jesus said , `` My children , I will be with you only a short time more .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Peter asked , `` Lord , why ca n't I follow you now ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The truth is , before the rooster crows , you will say three times that you do n't know me . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Later , Jesus appeared again to his followers by Lake Galilee .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is how it happened : Some of the followers were together -- Simon Peter , Thomas -LRB- called Didymus -RRB- , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the two sons of Zebedee , and two other followers .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Simon Peter said , `` I am going out to fish . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They fished that night but caught nothing .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the followers did not know it was Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then he said to them , `` Friends , have you caught any fish ? ''",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The follower Jesus loved very much said to Peter , `` That man is the Lord ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"They were not very far from shore , only about 100 yards .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Then Jesus said , `` Bring some of the fish that you caught . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net to the shore .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was full of big fish -- 153 of them !,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus said to them , `` Come and eat . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they finished eating , Jesus said to Simon Peter , `` Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these other men love me ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Peter was sad because Jesus asked him three times , `` Do you love me ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said to him , `` Take care of my sheep .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
-LRB- Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God . -RRB-,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then he said to Peter , `` Follow me ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Peter turned and saw the follower Jesus loved very much walking behind them .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-LRB- This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and said , `` Lord , who is it that will hand you over ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-RRB- When Peter saw him behind them , he asked Jesus , `` Lord , what about him ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` Maybe I want him to live until I come .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So a story spread among the followers of Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Jesus did not say he would not die .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are many other things that Jesus did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee , and Jesus ' mother was there .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus and his followers were also invited .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the wedding there was not enough wine , so Jesus '",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` Dear woman , why are you telling me this ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the Jews in their washing ceremonies .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Each one held about 20 or 30 gallons .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus said to the servants , `` Fill the waterpots with water . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He called the bridegroom and said to him , `` People always serve the best wine first .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
This was the first of all the miraculous signs Jesus did .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He did it in the town of Cana in Galilee .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then Jesus went to the town of Capernaum .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
They all stayed there a few days .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It was almost time for the Jewish Passover , so Jesus went to Jerusalem .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There in the Temple area he saw men selling cattle , sheep , and doves .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus made a whip with some pieces of rope .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then he forced all these men and the sheep and cattle to leave the Temple area .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When this happened , his followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures : `` My strong devotion to your Temple will destroy me . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some Jews said to Jesus , `` Show us a miracle as a sign from God .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They answered , `` People worked 46 years to build this Temple !",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the temple Jesus meant was his own body .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they believed the Scriptures , and they believed the words Jesus said .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover festival .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Jesus did not trust them , because he knew how all people think .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard the report that he was making and baptizing more followers than John .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"-LRB- But really , Jesus himself did not baptize anyone ; his followers baptized people for him . -RRB-",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So he left Judea and went back to Galilee .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
On the way to Galilee he had to go through the country of Samaria .,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar , which is near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .",1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , and Jesus said to her , `` Please give me a drink . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman ! '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
-LRB- Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans . -RRB-,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus answered , `` You do n't know what God can give you .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob ?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The woman said to Jesus , `` Sir , give me this water .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus told her , `` Go get your husband and come back . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said to her , `` You are right to say you have no husband .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That 's because , although you have had five husbands , the man you live with now is not your husband .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But you Jews say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship . '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus said , `` Believe me , woman !",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The time is coming when you will not have to be in Jerusalem or on this mountain to worship the Father .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We Jews understand what we worship , since salvation comes from the Jews .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
-LRB- Messiah is the one called Christ . -RRB-,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Then Jesus said , `` He is talking to you now -- I am the Messiah . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just then Jesus ' followers came back from town .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were surprised because they saw Jesus talking with a woman .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the people left the town and went to see Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"While the woman was in town , Jesus ' followers were begging him , `` Teacher , eat something ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Jesus answered , `` I have food to eat that you know nothing about . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said , `` My food is to do what the one who sent me wants me to do .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you plant , you always say , ' Four more months to wait before we gather the grain . '",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is true when we say , ' One person plants , but another person harvests the crop . '",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Many of the Samaritan people in that town believed in Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So he stayed there two days .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The people said to the woman , `` First we believed in Jesus because of what you told us .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Two days later Jesus left and went to Galilee .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
-LRB- Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . -RRB-,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When he arrived in Galilee , the people there welcomed him .",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
They had been at the Passover festival in Jerusalem and had seen everything he did there .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Jesus went to visit Cana in Galilee again .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cana is where he had changed the water into wine .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the king 's important officials lived in the city of Capernaum .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The man heard that Jesus had come from Judea and was now in Galilee .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son , who was almost dead .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said to him , `` You people must see miraculous signs and wonders before you will believe in me . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The man believed what Jesus told him and went home .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They answered , `` It was about one o'clock yesterday when the fever left him . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The father knew that one o'clock was the same time that Jesus had said , `` Your son will live . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the man and everyone in his house believed in Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the second miraculous sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Early in the morning he went back to the Temple area .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman they had caught in bed with a man who was not her husband .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"They said to Jesus , `` Teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were saying this to trick Jesus .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Jewish leaders continued to ask him their question .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So he stood up and said , `` Anyone here who has never sinned should throw the first stone at her . ''",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then Jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they heard this , they began to leave one by one .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The older men left first , and then the others .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Jesus was left alone with the woman standing there in front of him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then Jesus said , `` I do n't judge you either .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Later , Jesus talked to the people again .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the Pharisees said to Jesus , `` When you talk about yourself , you are the only one to say that these things are true .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` Yes , I am saying these things about myself .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus answered , `` You do n't know me or my Father .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple area , near the room where the Temple offerings were kept .",1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Again , Jesus said to the people , `` I will leave you .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So the Jewish leaders asked themselves , `` Will he kill himself ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But Jesus said to them , `` You people are from here below , but I am from above .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` I am what I have told you from the beginning .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So he said to them , `` You will lift up the Son of Man .",0,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , `` If you continue to accept and obey my teaching , you are really my followers .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They answered , `` We are Abraham 's descendants .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said , `` The truth is , everyone who sins is a slave -- a slave to sin .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you are Abraham 's descendants .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They said , `` Our father is Abraham . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said , `` If you were really Abraham 's descendants , you would do what Abraham did .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus said to them , `` If God were really your Father , you would love me .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Jews there answered , `` We say you are a Samaritan .",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus answered , `` I have no demon in me .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Jews said to Jesus , `` Now we know that you have a demon in you !",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Even Abraham and the prophets died .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham ?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jesus answered , `` If I give honor to myself , that honor is worth nothing .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your father Abraham was very happy that he would see the day when I came .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He saw that day and was happy . '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The Jews said to Jesus , `` What ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
How can you say you have seen Abraham ?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are not even 50 years old ! '',0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jesus answered , `` The fact is , before Abraham was born , I AM . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Jesus hid , and then he left the Temple area .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Later , Jesus went across Lake Galilee -LRB- also known as Lake Tiberias -RRB- .",1,1,1,0,0,0,0
Jesus went up on the side of the hill and sat there with his followers .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover festival .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Jesus looked up and saw a crowd of people coming toward him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said to Philip , `` Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat ? ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
He asked Philip this question to test him .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus already knew what he planned to do .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Philip answered , `` We would all have to work a month to buy enough bread for each person here to have only a little piece ! ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jesus took the loaves of bread and gave thanks for them .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they finished , Jesus said to his followers , `` Gather the pieces of fish and bread that were not eaten .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people had started eating with only five loaves of barley bread .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the followers filled twelve large baskets with the pieces of food that were left .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The people saw this miraculous sign that Jesus did and said , `` He must be the Prophet who is coming into the world . ''",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus knew that the people planned to come get him and make him their king .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
That evening Jesus ' followers went down to the lake .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was dark now , and Jesus had not yet come back to them .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
They got into a boat and started going across the lake to Capernaum .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
They rowed the boat about three or four miles .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
They knew that Jesus did not go with his followers in the boat .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
But then some boats from Tiberias came and landed near the place where the people had eaten the day before .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
The people found Jesus on the other side of the lake .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Son of Man will give you that food .,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I will raise them up on the last day .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I will raise them up on the last day .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Then the Jews began to argue among themselves .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

I will raise them up on the last day .,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of Capernaum .,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
"When Jesus ' followers heard this , many of them said , `` This teaching is hard .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jesus already knew that his followers were complaining about this .,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then what will you think when you see the Son of Man going up to where he came from ?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
It is the Spirit that gives life .,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But the things I have told you are from the Spirit , so they give life .",0,0,1,0,0,0,0
